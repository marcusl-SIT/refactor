The dataset we will be using contains two CSV files ‘features’ and ‘target’. You will receive the link on the day of the challenge.\n","\n","Each row in the ‘features’ belongs to a ‘measurement’ and each column represents a ‘feature’. For each row in the ‘features’ you have a corresponding class label in ‘target’. You can consider the row-numbers as keys.\n","\n","You will have to use data labelled as ‘train’ for implementing the models. You have to submit the results that you obtain from the predictions of your Machine Learning models from the data labelled as ‘test’.\n","\n","Complete the following:\n","\n","    Explore your data. Can you identify anything interest that is worth noting from the data?\n","    Define a set of possible classifiers and show which one performs best. Keep in mind the problem of overfitting.\n","    Using feature selection try to reduce the number of features. In the dataset you have over 120 features. Find the good ones for your classifier.\n","\n","Keep in mind that there is no best solution to the challenge. Show how you approach a problem, and the skills/methods you use in that approach.\n","\n","Evaluation Process:\n","\n","The relevant metric in scikit-learn to increase is f1_macro. After you finish your best model, please save your predictions to CSV file with the column names ‘Id’ and ‘Predicted’. No index column!\n","\n","Submit your CSV file in ‘Submit Predictions’ section.\n","\n","You can check your score in ‘My Submissions’ section and choose the one to make it Final Score by checking the ‘Use for Final Score’ checkbox."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":52,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":455,"status":"ok","timestamp":1702908937283,"user":{"displayName":"Jus
